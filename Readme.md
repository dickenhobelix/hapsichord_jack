Introduction
============

This is a somewhat unusual repo.
It aims to model jacks and tongues for a Wittmayer Hapsichord DBP 9219008
which previously had leather quills which faded over time and got brittle.

This project aims to offer a simple replacement by using delrin quills.
Instead of stuffing the delrin ones into the old tongues inrevertably,
it aims to replace them by 3D-Printed parts that actual fit to size.

Since all other parts are still intact and working nicely,
I did not model the rest of the instrument.

MCAD used
=========

The MCAD used is https://dune3d.org/ which is an opensource parametric 3D CAD. You can download it under the link provided.

If you do not want to modify the part itself, step files are provided.

Further parts and dimensions
============================

For assembly of jack and tongue you will also need:

On the tongue:

 - delrin quill, e.g. https://www.vogel-scheer.de/de/mechanik/1-3-plektra/delrin-plektra-vorintoniert.html
 - approx 18mm of 0.5mm dia spring steel wire

On the jack:
 - a 10mm diameter lead weight
 - a 10mm M2 screw with excentric head for regulating the quills distance to the string
 - 50mm of M2 threaded rod and 2 M2 nuts

For connecting both:

 - 15mm of 1mm dia steel wire as an axle
