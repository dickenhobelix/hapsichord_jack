Introduction
============

This is a somewhat unusual repo.
It aims to model jacks and tongues for a Wittmayer Hapsichord DBP 9219008
which previously had leather quills which faded over time and got brittle.

This project aims to offer a simple replacement by using delrin quills.
Instead of stuffing the delrin ones into the old tongues inrevertably,
it aims to replace them by 3D-Printed parts that actual fit to size.

Since all other parts are still intact and working nicely,
I did not model the rest of the instrument.

MCAD used
